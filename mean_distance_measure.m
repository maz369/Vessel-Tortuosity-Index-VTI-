% Mean distance measure (DM) between points where the convexity of a curve changes. The curve or vessel 
% centerline is defined by x & y coordinates.

% Distance measure is the ratio of vessel length to its chord length. This can be used as a rough approximation 
% of tortuosity. However, this global estimation may not match human perception of tortuosity (Grisan, et al
% 2008). In the current work, we used local distance measure between inflection points and showed that it better 
% matches with visual perception of tortuosity.

% tomography angiography applied to sickle cell retinopathy." Biomedical optics express 8.8 (2017):3796-3806.
