% Function for calculating tortuosity of vessels based on its centerline in 2D. Initially implemented for 
% retinal vessels but theoretically applicable to any 2D curvilinear shape.

% x & y represent coordinates of vessel centerline or any curvilinear shape.

% is_show equals 1 for graphical demonstration, otherwise set to 0. This option is to help with obtaining 
% an intuitive understanding of parameters and can be set to 0 in a real application.

% ========================================= PARAMETER EXPLANATION ==========================================
% VTI: vessel tortuosity index.
% sd: standard deviation of the angels between lines tangent to every pixel along the centerline.
% mean_dm: average distance measure between inflection points along the centerline.
% num_inflection_pts: number of inflection points along the centerline.
% num_critical_pts: number of critical points along the centerline.
% len_arch: length of vessel (arch) which is number of centerline pixels.
% len_cord: length of vessel chord which is the shortest path connecting vessel end points.
% VTI = (len_arch * sd * num_critical_pts * (mean_dm)) / len_cord;
